# Choose Your Own Adventure: Work Edition

This app is just intended to help the user make decisions about what the next step of their day should be.

In the future, I plan to integrate a to-do list, project list, and calender, so rather than just having to actively reference these sources, the app can just pick the user's next next task based on the answers to these questions running in the background. This will essentially be a smart-task list.
